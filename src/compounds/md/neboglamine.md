## Mechanism of Action

The brain naturally produces a neurotransmitter named D-Serine, and Neboglamine potentiates its binding co-agonist site, specifically. 

As a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA glycine site, Neboglamine produces specific advantages over glutamate modulators and D-Serine alike, of which it more closely resembles in the brain. It is also a weak norepinephrine uptake inhibitor.

Based on the literature, it can be *expected* that Neboglamine produces antidepressant <a title="Acute amino acid D-serine administration, similar to ketamine, produces antidepressant-like effects through the identical mechanisms" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source1">[1]</a><a title="Acute D-serine treatment produces antidepressant-like effects in rodents" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source2">[2]</a><a title="Xytis XY2401 Product Pipeline" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source9">[9]</a></a><a title="Pilot controlled trial of d-serine for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source10">[10]</a>, nootropic <a title="Behavioral and cognitive effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor co-agonist D-serine in healthy humans: initial findings" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source4">[4]</a><a title="The effect of D-serine administration on cognition and mood in older adults" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source5">[5]</a><a title="CR 2249: a New Putative Memory Enhancer.

Interestingly, it could produce an anti-hedonistic effect as well, including drug addiction <a title="Xytis XY2401 Product Pipeline" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source9">[9]</a><a title="D-serine facilitates the effects of extinction to reduce cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source13">[13]</a><a title="D-Serine and D-Cycloserine Reduce Compulsive Alcohol Intake in Rats" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source14">[14]</a><a title="Morphine-induced inhibition of Ca2+ -dependent d-serine release from astrocytes suppresses excitability of GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source15">[15]</a>, diet preference <a title="Control of Appetite and Food Preference by NMDA Receptor and Its Co-Agonist d-Serine" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source16">[16]</a> and *potentially* aberrant sexuality <a title="A glial amino-acid transporter controls synapse strength and homosexual courtship in Drosophila" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source17">[17]</a>.

D-Serine produces an antidepressant-like effect, which is mediated by increased glutamate release, similarly to Ketamine (although increased glycine site activity can also reverse cognitive deficits induced by Ketamine <a title="Acute amino acid D-serine administration, similar to ketamine, produces antidepressant-like effects through the identical mechanisms" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source1">[1]</a><a title="Glycine transporter inhibitor attenuates the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in healthy males: preliminary evidence" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source3">[3]</a>). This glutamate binds to AMPA, which causes a release of BDNF and thus mTOR. Since D-Serine is a weak antagonist at AMPA <a title="Behavioral and cognitive effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor co-agonist D-serine in healthy humans: initial findings" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source4">[4]</a>, Neboglamine potentiates AMPA activity more than D-Serine, in addition to being stronger in general. It looks like before Xytis (the pharmaceutical company licensing Neboglamine) went under, antidepressant effects were confirmed in people <a title="Xytis XY2401 Product Pipeline" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source9">[9]</a>. D-Serine has also been noted to restore mate seeking in depressed rats <a title="Acute D-serine treatment produces antidepressant-like effects in rodents" rel="noreferrer" class="ref" href="#source2">[2]</a>.
