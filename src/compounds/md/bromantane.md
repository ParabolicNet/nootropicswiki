## Pharmacology

Bromantane is a compound that upregulates dopamine, with effects lasting after discontinuation.

Bromantaneâ€™s mechanism of action primarily involves enhancing dopamine synthesis through upregulation of key enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) via indirect genomic pathways. Bromantane elevates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which disinhibits TH (usually blocked by dopamine), leading to increased dopamine synthesis.

Additionally, Bromantane is hypothesized to act as a Kir2.1 channel inhibitor (but MOA is unknown), stabilizing indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (IMSNs) and preventing aberrant synaptogenesis. Moreover, Bromantane reduces inflammatory cytokines <a title="Thus, the antiasthenic drug ladasten limits development of the anxious depressive state and suppresses the level ofproinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-17 and IL-4." class="ref" href="#source4">[4]</a> and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) <a title="Ladasten reduced HDAC1 level in rat striatum and hippocampus and modified H3acK9 and H4acK8 levels in various structures of rat brain." class="ref" href="#source5">[5]</a>, upregulating neurotrophins like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), contributing to its neuroprotective effects.

Bromantane upregulates dopamine without being addictive or having tolerance <a title="The absence of 'withdrawal syndrome' after the drug withdrawal reveals the lack of addictive potential in this drug." class="ref" href="#source1">[1]</a><a title="Effect of bromantane on the rat neurologic status in two month course" class="ref" href="#source2">[2]</a><a title="The effects of ladasten on dopaminergic neurotransmission and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats" class="ref" href="#source13">[13]</a>. It also reduces anxiety <a title="Effect of bromantane on the rat neurologic status in two month course" class="ref" href="#source6">[6]</a>, improves physical performance and sex drive <a title="Effects of bromantane and sidnocarb on long-term operant conditioning and its vegetative correlates in rats" class="ref" href="#source7">[7]</a><a title="A three-day treatment with [bromantane] (...) predominantly increased the sexual proceptivity, whereas a chronic administration (for 2 months in males and 2 weeks in females) produced a dose-dependent increase in both proceptivity and receptivity." class="ref" href="#source8">[8]</a><a title="The positive effect of bromantan (0.5-50 mg/kg) on the efficiency of physical work of mice and rats (swimming test, running on a treadmill) exceeds that of phenamine administered in optimal doses by 1.3-1.6 times." class="ref" href="#source9">[9]</a>, protects mithcondria and cellular membranes <a title="The data obtained suggest that the positive effect of bromantan on the physical efficiency is associated not only with its psychostimulating action but also with the membrane-protecting effect." class="ref" href="#source9">[9]</a>, enhances learning <a title="The neuro- and psychophysiological effects of bromantane" class="ref" href="#source10">[10]</a><a title="Mechanisms of Action of Ladasten: Activation of Gene Expression for Neurotrophins and Mitogen-Activated Kinases" class="ref" href="#source11">[11]</a><a title="The effects of ladasten on dopaminergic neurotransmission and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats" class="ref" href="#source13">[13]</a>, elevates CREB <a title="The effects of ladasten on dopaminergic neurotransmission and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats" class="ref" href="#source13">[13]</a>, and is anti-fibrotic <a title="Bromantane (NP-160) Exhibited Potent Anti-Fibrotic Activity in NASH and CKD Studies" class="ref" href="#source14">[14]</a>.
