## Pharmacology

Tropisetron is a partial α7-nicotinic receptor agonist and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It is comparable to GTS-21, however it is much better as it does not have GTS-21's side effects.

Addiction - This is people's first thought when they hear "nicotinic". But nicotine is not a selective α7 agonist, and in fact it has more bias towards α4. This is what causes dopamine release, and therefore euphoria and addiction <a title="Activation and Desensitization of Nicotinic α7-type Acetylcholine Receptors by Benzylidene Anabaseines and Nicotine" class="ref" href="#source1">[1]</a><a title="Chronic Nicotine Cell Specifically Upregulates Functional α4* Nicotinic Receptors" class="ref" or href="#source2">[2]</a>.
