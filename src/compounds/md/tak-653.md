## Mechanism of Action

TAK-653 is a selective AMPA PAM (Positive Allosteric Modulator) that does not agonize resting AMPA receptors. This is important, because TAK-653 is not only safer, but it enhances cognition beyond the capacity of AMPA PAMs that act as agonists <a title="Strictly regulated agonist-dependent activation of AMPA-R is the key characteristic of TAK-653 for robust synaptic responses and cognitive improvement" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93888-0">[1]</a>. It is comparable to Piracetam and deriveratives, but it is more selective towards AMPA.

The result is an improvement to working memory and cognitive flexibility without seizures or other forms of toxicity. This is documented in TAK's preclinical studies, but also in general with AMPA PAMs. Piracetam for instance, the first nootropic, is an AMPA PAM. TAK-653 has went through two phase 1 clinical trials, where it was found to be safe and without side effects. It is under investigation for treatment resistant depression, after TAK-653 improved depression similarly to ketamine (at high doses), but without damaging cognition <a title="TAK-653, an AMPA receptor potentiator with minimal agonistic activity, produces an antidepressant-like effect with a favorable safety profile in rats" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009130572100188X">[2]</a>.
