The Dorsolateral Pre-Frontal Cortex (dlPFC) is one of the most interesting parts of the brain. It has very significant implications on spatial cognition and working memory, visualizing, executive function and more. It is one of the most important, yet one of the most underfocused areas for the goal of increasing cognitive potential.

Rodents do not have rostral PFC areas (e.g. Frontal Pole) or a dlPFC, so it makes it more difficult to study due to the requirement for primates or humans to study upon. Due to these reasons, and the focus for cognition being mainly on the hippocampus and other areas of the brain, the dlPFC and nearby regions seem more underresearched than they should be.

The dlPFC is one of the most recently evolved/developed areas of the brain, in close quarters with the Frontal Pole Cortex (FPC/Brodmann area 10/10p). It is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041807/">much more dependent</a> (~5x more dependent) on NMDA-NR2b than AMPA compared to other parts of the cortex, in this case it is compared against the Visual Cortex (for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654322/full">Delay Cell Firing</a>).

This is part of the reason why the dlPFC and surrounding areas are so vulnerable to aging-based deteriation. -tbf-

The dlPFC has a lot of important functions, but something to note as we start, is that the dlPFC is heavily impacted by mGluR2 and mGluR3 firing. Modulating either of these, directly, or via other mechanisms like NAAG or GCP-II, has significant impacts on Delay Cell Firing and the function of the dlPFC (working memory, cognition, etc).

Delay Cells (which will be mentioned often) reside in pyramidal cell microcircuits in deep layer III (the most cognitively important layer) of the dlPFC that have extensive recurrent excitatory connections.

### Functions of the dlPFC

The primate dlPFC has the remarkable ability to generate and sustain mental representations without sensory stimulation, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/0896-6273(95)90304-6.pdf">the foundation of abstract thought</a>.

dlPFC “Delay cells” are able to maintain persistent firing across the delay period in a working memory task, sustaining representations over many seconds e.g., remembering a position in visual space <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.1989.61.2.331">[3]</a>. The persistent firing of Delay cells across the delay period depends on NMDAR stimulation <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584418/">[4]</a>, a finding predicted by computational models (33). Thus, iontophoresis (local electrical application) of low doses of NMDAR antagonists, including antagonists that selectively block those with GluN2A or GluN2B subunits, markedly reduces Delay cell firing.

### The Top-Down Control Dichotomy

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/firing.jpg" height="340px" alt="Example of dlPFC control direction">

The dlPFC interacts through BA10m (close to the PFC) and BA32 to eventually communicate with the amagdyla. The more newly evolved, rostral and lateral areas of PFC provide top-down regulation of the more primitive medial and caudal areas.

For example, the dlPFC can regulates emotion via direct projections to BA24 <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4998921/">[1]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6165607/">[2]</a>, and indirect projections to BA25 via BA10m or BA32 to BA25.

Under conditions of stress or depression, elevated activity in the cingulate cortices can activate the amygdala, and very high levels of catecholamine release in cortex takes higher PFC areas such as dlPFC “offline.” Dopamine hyperactivation and hypersexual stimuli *likely* have this effect too. **Thus, there is a self-perpetuating, unregulated state, where primitive circuits prevail.**

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/models.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Example of dlPFC dichotomy">

> "Many antidepressant treatments (seretonin modulators, psychedelics, *maybe even <a target="_blank" href="/details/pinealon">pinealon</a>*) reduce the activity of BA25. This may give the cortex a “foot in the door” to restore top-down regulation, especially when treatments promote dendritic spine restoration in higher PFC circuits. Other treatments may directly enhance the top-down regulation by the left dlPFC, e.g., rTMS and insight therapies."

The anti-addictive, anti-hedonistic, and pro-executive function of optimal dlPFC firing has been shown consistently across many studies.

This then shows the importance of the dlPFC in regulating emotion and top-down control/executive function. However, just BA25 modulation alone has its limits. Lowering BA25 activity may lower the control of the amagyla over the higher cortex areas, but how can we truly maximize the function of the dlPFC so we can have the highest amount of cognitive control and Delay Cell Firing?

We can do this by modulating mGluR2/3 interactions, which seem to have the largest effect on the function of the dlPFC.

### Group II mGluRs (mGlu2/mGlu3)

This is a good time to talk about NAAG (N-Acetylaspartylglutamic Acid) and GCP-II (Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II/NAAG peptidase).

<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074742719300061">NAAG is a neurotransmitter that increases mGluR3 through agonism</a>. NAAG is inactivated by a glial enzyme GCP-II, so when GCP-II is focused, mGluR3 signaling is increased through GCP-II -> NAAG -> mGLuR3. GCP-II inhibition looks like one of the most promising ways of increasing mGLuR3 firing, and inhibiting it has other benefits too. It looks more beneficial over directly administered NAAG, because administered NAAG seems to increase unpreferred firing.

mGluR2 interacts with mGluR3 to control Delay Cell Firing in the dlPFC. mGluR2 is mostly located presynaptically while mGluR3 is mostly located postsynaptically.

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/postpre.jpg" height="300px" alt="Example of post/pre">
<figcaption><small>mGluR3 is concentrated postsynaptically in spine synapses of layer III dlPFC. In contrast, mGluR2 is principally presynaptic as expected, with only a minor postsynaptic component.</small></figcaption>

Cognitive deficits in disorders such as schizophrenia, aging, and Alzheimer's are increasingly associated with insults to mGluR3 receptors, while reductions in mGluR2 appear protective. This has been perplexing, as mGluR3 has been considered glial receptors, and mGluR2 and mGluR3 have been thought to have similar functions, reducing glutamate transmission. However, all the evidence points to mGluR2 and mGluR3 having opposing functions.

<figcaption><small>Working model of mGluR2 and mGluR3 actions in a layer III dlPFC glutamatergic synapse.</small></figcaption>

> GCPII inhibition as well as a heterotropic mGluR/3 agonist restores short-term object recognition in mice treated with intoxicating doses (2.3 g/l) of ethanol (Olszewski et al., 2017).

Higher NAAG levels are associated with better cognition, suggesting that increasing NAAG levels through FOLH1/GCPII inhibition may improve cognition, and this has been shown consistently across primate and rodent models.

### Neuroprotection

In several PD models, improved motor activity and enhanced neuroprotection have been reported with mGluR3 agonists.
