## Introduction

--- This article is a WIP ---

The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsolateral_prefrontal_cortex">Dorsolateral Pre-Frontal Cortex (dlPFC)</a> is one of the most interesting parts of the brain. It has very significant implications on spatial cognition and working memory, visualizing, executive function and more. It is one of the most important, yet one of the most underfocused areas for the goal of increasing cognitive potential. 

Rodents do not have rostral PFC areas (e.g. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21388858/">Frontal Pole</a>) or a dlPFC, so it makes it more difficult to study due to the requirement for primates or humans to study upon. Due to these reasons, and the focus for cognition being mainly on the hippocampus and other areas of the brain, the dlPFC and nearby regions seem more underresearched than they should be.

The dlPFC is one of the most recently evolved/developed areas of the brain, in close quarters with the Frontal Pole Cortex (FPC/<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_10">Brodmann area 10/10p</a>). The dlPFC is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041807/">much more dependent</a> (~5x more dependent) on NMDA-NR2b than AMPA compared to other parts of the cortex, in this case it is compared against the Visual Cortex (for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654322/full">Delay Cell Firing</a>).

This is part of the reason why the dlPFC and surrounding areas are so vulnerable to aging-based deteriation. -tbf-

The dlPFC has a lot of important functions, but something to note as we start, is that the dlPFC is heavily impacted by mGluR2 and mGluR3 firing. Modulating either of these, directly, or via other mechanisms like NAAG or GCP-II, has significant impacts on Delay Cell Firing and the function of the dlPFC (working memory, cognition, etc).

Delay Cells (which will be mentioned often) reside in pyramidal cell microcircuits in deep layer III (the most cognitively important layer) of the dlPFC that have extensive recurrent excitatory connections.

## Functions of the dlPFC

The primate dlPFC has the remarkable ability to generate and sustain mental representations without sensory stimulation, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/0896-6273(95)90304-6.pdf">the foundation of abstract thought</a>.

dlPFC “Delay cells” are able to maintain persistent firing across the delay period in a working memory task, sustaining representations over many seconds e.g., remembering a position in visual space <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.1989.61.2.331">[3]</a>. The persistent firing of Delay cells across the delay period depends on NMDAR stimulation <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584418/">[4]</a>, a finding predicted by computational models (33). Thus, iontophoresis (local electrical application) of low doses of NMDAR antagonists, including antagonists that selectively block those with GluN2A or GluN2B subunits, markedly reduces Delay cell firing.

> "The selective NMDAR- GluN2B antagonist, TCN237, completely blocks the ability of the neuron to generate representations of visual space."

In another study, dlPFC damage was associated with deficits in the manipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge, with left dlPFC necessary for manipulating information in working memory and right dlPFC critical for manipulating information in a broader range of reasoning contexts. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22789779/">[Source]</a>

The dlPFC has implications in detecting threats <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35231420/">[Source]</a>, pattern recognition, consciousness/consciousness awareness <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18514741/">[Source]</a>, risk taking, mental health, possibly even endurance due to effort-cost judgements <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020275/">[Source]</a> and many other things. So, lets look into it.

<span id="dl2"></span>
## The Top-Down Control Dichotomy

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/firing.jpg" height="340px" alt="Example of dlPFC control direction">

The dlPFC interacts through BA10m (close to the PFC) and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_32">BA32</a> to eventually communicate with the amagdyla. The more newly evolved, rostral and lateral areas of PFC provide top-down regulation of the more primitive medial and caudal areas. The dlPFC  is a key structure for executive and attentional control whereby any transient (stressors, neurostimulation) or permanent (lesion) impairment compromises adaptive behavior <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30878500/">[Source]</a>.

For example, the dlPFC can regulate emotion via direct projections to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_24">BA24</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4998921/">[1]</a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6165607/">[2]</a>, and indirect projections to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a> via BA10m or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_32">BA32</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a>.

> The dlPFC provides top-down regulation of emotion through indirect projections to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a> via areas BA10m and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_32">BA32</a>, and direct projections to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_24">BA24</a> (not shown) <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654322/full">[Source]</a>.

Under conditions of stress or depression, elevated activity in the cingulate cortices can activate the amygdala, and very high levels of catecholamine release in cortex takes higher PFC areas such as dlPFC “offline.” The effects of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5611728/">dopamine hyperactivation and hypersexual stimuli</a> likely work via this same pathway too effect too. **Thus, there is a self-perpetuating, unregulated state, where primitive circuits prevail.**

It seems easier for women to lose this top-down control compared to men. In women, the interaction between emotion and working memory yielded a significantly stronger response in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compared to their male counterparts. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17544015/">[Source]</a>

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/models.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Example of dlPFC dichotomy">

> "Many antidepressant treatments (seretonin modulators, psychedelics, *maybe even <a target="_blank" href="/details/pinealon">pinealon</a>*) reduce the activity of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a>. This may give the cortex a “foot in the door” to restore top-down regulation, especially when treatments promote dendritic spine restoration in higher PFC circuits. Other treatments may directly enhance the top-down regulation by the left dlPFC, e.g., rTMS and insight therapies."

The anti-addictive, anti-hedonistic, and pro-executive function of optimal dlPFC firing has been shown consistently across many studies.

> "Excitatory neuromodulation targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex appears to lead to a sustained reduction of craving and consumption in individuals with addiction or overeating behaviour.' <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34514666/">[Source]</a>

>  The group which received active DLPFC tDCS showed significantly improved task performance across all EFs immediately after and 1 month following the intervention, when compared to both pre-stimulation baseline and individuals who received sham tDCS. Similarly, a significant reduction in craving was observed immediately after and 1 month following the intervention in the active, but not sham stimulation group. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32289681/">[Source]</a>

This then shows the importance of the dlPFC in regulating emotion and top-down control/executive function. However, just <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a> modulation alone has its limits. Lowering <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area_25">BA25</a> activity may lower the control of the amagyla over the higher cortex areas, but how can we truly maximize the function of the dlPFC so we can have the highest amount of cognitive control and Delay Cell Firing?

We can do this by modulating mGluR2/3 (also known as group II mGluRs) interactions, which seem to have the largest effect on the function of the dlPFC.

<span id="mg1"></span>
## Group II mGluRs (mGlu2/mGlu3)

mGluR2 interacts with mGluR3 to control Delay Cell Firing in the dlPFC. Group II mGluRs are <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2004.03378.x">primarily presynaptic autoreceptor</a> with the function to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2018.00508/full">inhibit glutamate transmission.</a>. However, both mGluR2 and mGluR3 can be found postsynaptically in regions such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5974790/">dlPFC</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12948448/">Golgi cells</a> respectively. mGluR3 can even be localized <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8684625/">glially</a> with astrocytic processes. In DLPFC, while mGluR2 is mostly located presynaptically as expected mGluR3 is mostly located here postsynaptically.

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/postpre.jpg" height="300px" alt="Example of post/pre">
<figcaption><small>mGluR3 is concentrated postsynaptically in spine synapses of layer III dlPFC. In contrast, mGluR2 is principally presynaptic as expected, with only a minor postsynaptic component.</small></figcaption>

Cognitive deficits in disorders such as schizophrenia, aging, and Alzheimer's are increasingly associated with insults to mGluR3 receptors, while reductions in mGluR2 appear protective. This has been perplexing, as mGluR3 has been considered glial receptors, and mGluR2 and mGluR3 have been thought to have similar functions, reducing glutamate transmission. However, all the evidence points to mGluR2 and mGluR3 having opposing functions.

<img class="md-img" src="/images/articles/mglurs.png" height="300px" alt="Example of mGluRs">
<figcaption><small>Working model of mGluR2 and mGluR3 actions in a layer III dlPFC glutamatergic synapse.</small></figcaption>

mGluR2 reduces Delay Cell Firing and glutamate, while mGluR3 increases Delay Cell Firing. Therefore, by increasing mGlu3 activity and lowering mGlu2 activity, we can increase Delay Cell Firing, which in turn increases the function of the dlPFC.

<span id="mg2"></span>
## mGluR3 Modulation

This is a good time to talk about <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylaspartylglutamic_acid">NAAG</a> (N-Acetylaspartylglutamic Acid) and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_carboxypeptidase_II">GCP-II</a> (Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II/NAAG peptidase).

NAAG is an endogenous neurotransmitter that increases <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074742719300061">mGluR3 activity through agonism</a>. NAAG is thought to be agonist of mGluR3 and with some actions on NMDA however it is debated its due to contamination with glutamate as purified NAAG had <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389924/">non-agonistic activity</a> in one study suggesting it might be a PAM, while other study showed no significant effects on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19285517/">group II mGluRs and NMDA</a>. Further study needs to re-valulate effects of pure NAAG but it definitely looks like it has some pro mGluR3 actions. 

NAAG is inactivated by a glial enzyme GCP-II, so when GCP-II is inhibited, mGluR3 signaling is increased through GCP-II -> NAAG -> mGLuR3. GCP-II inhibition looks like one of the most promising ways of increasing mGLuR3 firing, and inhibiting it has other benefits too. It looks more beneficial over directly administered NAAG, because administered NAAG seems to increase unpreferred firing.

> "GCP-II inhibition as well as a heterotropic mGluR/3 agonist restores short-term object recognition in mice treated with intoxicating doses (2.3 g/l) of ethanol (Olszewski et al., 2017)."

Higher NAAG levels are associated with better cognition, suggesting that increasing NAAG levels through FOLH1/GCPII inhibition may improve cognition, and this has been shown consistently across primate and rodent models.

Inhibiting GCP-II also has been shown to be analgesic in many models (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23776202/">potentially with lasting effects</a>), which makes sense as the dlPFC overlooks pain signaling, and GCP-II inhibition enhances dlPFC function. It has also been shown to decrease excitatory neurotransmission and inflammation-induced plasticity within the amygdala in a mouse model <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152775/">[Source]</a>. It currently seems like GCP-II inhibition decreases glutamate release in the amygdala, however this has yet to be confirmed with microdialysis studies.

## mGluR2 Modulation

Even though mGluR3 can reduce glutamate via both <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12964-022-00866-8">presynaptic actions</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02657.x">glial action</a> leading to consequent upregulated EAATs and glutamate uptake, but mGluR2 is much <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690373/">more potent</a> at reducing glutamate transmission as compared to mGluR3. Excess glutamate associated excitotoxicity is implicated in Alzheimer's disease yet mGluR2 activation <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21159998/">worsens amyloid-beta toxicity</a>. mGluR2 inhibition is also thought to be <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3064746/">mechanism of psychedelics</a> leading to antidepressant effect. In terms of cognition, mGluR2 but not mGluR3 has <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28108498/">inverted dose-effect response</a> on dlPFC Delay cell firing and WM improvements. Despite this, no mGluR2 NAM have been shown to have cognitive impairing effects yet. Thus, mGluR2 inhibition along with mGluR3 activation should fine tune our glutamate system.

<span id="mg4"></span>
## Neuroprotection

In several PD models, improved motor activity and enhanced neuroprotection have been reported with mGluR3 agonists.
